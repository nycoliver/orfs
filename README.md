# Planetary Link

A Decentralized peer to peer social network. IPFS + cjdns.

# Development

IPFS Daemon needs to be running locally. See https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs for details.
In the future this will use https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs to avoid any external dependencies.

    npm install
    npm start
